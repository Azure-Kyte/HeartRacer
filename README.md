# HeartRacer
HeartRacer was an entry for the TasJam For Health 2015. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the song, which you do by physically jumping and ducking to avoid the oncoming obstacles. This functionality is provided by an Arduino that sends the player's state to the game. The player stands on a pressure pad, which makes the character in-game jump when they leave the pad (generally by jumping). Positioned above the pad is a light sensor, placed at about shoulder height, which is used to detect whether the player is ducking.

The idea behind HeartRacer was to create an interactive music-based experience to aid in rehabilitation.
